<p>Once you have the court order and primary identification in your new
name, you can change your name almost everywhere else without issue.
Some places will even allow for digital updates by scanning in the ID
and court order. What follows is a list of places, in no particular
order, where you may want to update your name. Any forms that you fill
out should be signed in your new name.</p>

<p><strong>Bank</strong>: Bring your new ID and court order and request
the name on your account(s) be changed. If you have a debit card or
checkbook out of this account, then you will need to request new ones.
Any joint account holders must also be present to sign.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Card</strong>: Most creditors will require you to
snail mail or fax a photocopy of your ID and court order. If a
particular company is stubborn in updating the account name, consider
canceling the card and opening a new card with them or another
provider.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong>: If you have an HR system, bring your new ID,
new social security card, and court order to them and ask them to update
your name. If you get your health insurance through your work, you can
have them send the updated information to them on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Providers</strong>: You should be able to bring
in only your new ID at your next in-person visit and go to the front
secretaries to have your name updated in the system. Be aware that
certain medical professionals will need to know your transition
status.</p>
<p><strong>Gas/Heating Provider</strong>: DTE has a digital submission link for your scanned ID and court
order at <a

They will give you a call at some point after you submit the documents
to confirm the change.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Provider</strong>: Consumers allows its customers to change the name on the billing
account over the phone; their service number is (800) 477-5050. You will
need to confirm your old name &amp; address on the account.</p>
<p><strong>Water/Sewer</strong>: Should be able to be done by phone,
email, or snail mail.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Provider</strong>: Should be able to be done
online.</p>

<p><strong>Property/House Title</strong>: Contact your county’s
Registry of Deeds. ID and court order are both required.</p>
<p><strong>Phone Service</strong>: Go to the nearest store of your
carrier network with your new ID and court order and request your
information be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes (IRS)</strong>: The IRS will be informed of your name
change when you update your information with Social Security. You do not
need to contact them.</p>
<p><strong>Primary School Records</strong>: Each school will have different
requirements and protocols; contact them and see what theirs is. Be
aware that Michigan law does not require your high school to update your
educational records, so it is possible that they may refuse.</p>
<p><strong>College Records</strong>: Contact the Student Records Department of
your university. Required documents will vary by institution. You may
also consider updating your school profile and email, if
applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong>: Contact your insurer(s). Requirements
will vary.</p>
<p><strong>Government Assistance</strong>: Contact your assistance
agency to update their case file. You should only need a primary ID and
court order.</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong>: Michigan has automatic voter
registration, so no action is required unless you opted out when
renewing your primary ID. If you were too young for that step, then it
will be put in your correct name &amp; gender the first time you
register to vote.</p>
