<p> Your filing location is {{ court.address }}.
You may file by mail or in person; in either case, include the Petition
(pc51c) the Addendum (m97a), the optional Fee Waiver (mc20), as well
as payment. Even if the fee waiver is granted you still need to provide
payment for at least one certified copy. No matter how you file we
recommend that you call the court at {{ court.phone }} or visit their 
website at {{ court.website }}. This is to confirm their accepted 
payment types, Name Change Petition fee, and Certified Copy fee
as these vary by county and are updated regularly.

	Whoever filled out the paperwork as your petitioner has to be the
	one who files the paperwork at court if you are doing in-person filing.

<p><strong>By state law, court clerks are barred from answering
questions about the forms.</strong> We recommend that you direct any
questions you may have to the courtâ€™s legal assistance center, a local
LGBT organization, or an attorney. The clerk will return a copy of the
Petition to Change Name with a case number.</p>

<p> Once the paperwork has been filed it will be several weeks before
you get a response. From this point you just need to wait. The vast
majority of cases will not even have a hearing you will simply recieve
your court order and certified copy in the mail. The few cases that 
may get a hearing are usually due to a judge wanting clarification on 
a criminal record although judges can technically call a hearing for any 
reason. To be clear they are only allowed to deny a name 
change if they have reason to believe that it is to escape the law 
or creditors.
