Your filing location is {{ court.address }}.
You may file by mail or in person; in either case, include all the forms
listed in Part 1, as well as payment. If you are filing by mail, you
must pay by check or money order. If you are filing in person, we
recommend that you call the court at {{ court.phone }} to confirm their
open hours and accepted payment types.

<p><strong>By state law, court clerks are barred from answering
questions about the forms.</strong> We recommend that you direct any
questions you may have to the court’s legal assistance center, a local
LGBT organization, or an attorney. The clerk will return a copy of the
Petition to Change Name with a case number.</p>

<p>While you do these next steps, we recommend that you call the court
every few weeks until you receive your court hearing date to make sure
that there were no mistakes. Do not simply wait for a notice in the
mail.</p>

	<p>The following location(s) are recommended for fingerprinting in your county:
	<ul>
	{% for loc in fingerprintLocations %}
		<li>{{ loc.name }}, {{ loc.address }} <a href="{{ loc.website }}">{{ loc.website }}</a></li>
	{% endfor %}
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>If you cannot schedule an appointment online at the listed URL, you
	will need to schedule by phone or email, using the information listed on
	their website. We also recommend that you check their accepted payment
	options.</p>
	<p>At your appointment, you will probably be asked if you want an FBI or
	state fingerprint card; either is acceptable. Do not use live-scan
	fingerprinting services unless so instructed by the court. <strong>Do
	not bend or fold your fingerprint card.</strong></p>
	<p>After receiving your fingerprint card, mail it to:</p>
	<p>Michigan State Police</p>
	<p>CJIC</p>
	<p>PO Box 30266, Lansing, MI 48909</p>
	<p>Enclose a copy of your Petition to Change Name and a check in the amount of $43.25 made out to the State of Michigan.</p>

<p>Upon filing the Petition to Change Name, you may be instructed by the
clerk to place a legal notice with a local newspaper. If you were not,
we recommend that you confirm that the court is handling this, as well
as in which paper they are publishing. If they are, wait for an invoice
from that paper. Remit payment by check at your earliest convenience. If
you do not pay at least seven days in advance of your hearing date, your
hearing may be canceled or postponed.</p>
<p>If you were instructed to place the notice yourself, the
court-approved newspapers in your county are as follows:</p>
<ul>
{% for paper in publications %}
	<li>{{ paper.name }} (<a href"{{ paper.website }}">{{ paper.website }}</a>)</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>At the provided link, contact the newspaper about placing a legal
notice for your name change hearing. Make sure the publication date is
more than seven days before your court date. After a few days, confirm
with the court that they have received the necessary paperwork from the
newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="court-hearing">4. Court Hearing</h3>
<p>On the day of your hearing, you{% if age < 18 %} and your parent(s){%
endif %} should dress appropriately for a courtroom, even if the hearing
is virtual. The hearing may begin late, but it should only take a few
minutes once it starts.</p>
<p>Please note that your hearing is public, and it is possible for
others to attend, including objectors. If this is a concern for you,
consider an in-person hearing, and bring supportive friends.</p>
<p>You{% if age < 18 %}r parent(s){% endif %} will be sworn in and
questioned. The questions vary from court to court, but you can expect
some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your current legal name?</li>
<li>What is your desired legal name?</li>
<li>What is your date of birth?</li>
<li>Have you lived in this county for over a year?</li>
<li>Are you doing this for fraudulent reasons?</li>
<li>Have you paid the publication fee to an approved newspaper?</li>
<li>In your own words, why do you want to change your name?</li>
<li>Is there anything else you’d like the court to know?</li>
<li>You may also be asked “Do you know of anyone who would oppose this
name change?” The authors of this guide are not lawyers, but our understanding is
that, having answered “no” to the “fraudulent reasons” question,
you can answer “no” to this one. In particular, <strong>you
can safely disregard any “opposition” on purely transphobic
grounds.</strong> (Compare the history of the phrase “speak now or
forever hold your peace.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point the name change should be granted and the hearing
should end promptly. The document that you will need to get afterward is
called the “Order Following Hearing On Petition To Change Name,” but we
will call it the “court order”. You will probably be asked whether you
want to pick up your court order at the court or have it mailed. The
court should have the order ready for pickup within a few hours or the
next day. Mailing the order will take several days. Be sure to request a
certified copy of your court order.</p>
<p>Once you have the certified copy of the court order, you are ready to
file with the Social Security administration. Keep the original court
order in a safe place.</p>
