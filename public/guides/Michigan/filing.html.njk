<p> Your filing location is {{ court.address }}.
You may file by mail or in person; in either case, include the Petition
(pc51c) the Addendum (m97a), the optional Fee Waiver (mc20), as well
as payment. If you are filing by mail, you must pay by check or money
order. If you are filing in person, we recommend that you call the
court at {{ court.phone }} to confirm their open hours and accepted
payment types.

<p><strong>By state law, court clerks are barred from answering
questions about the forms.</strong> We recommend that you direct any
questions you may have to the courtâ€™s legal assistance center, a local
LGBT organization, or an attorney. The clerk will return a copy of the
Petition to Change Name with a case number.</p>

<p> Once the paperwork has been filed it will be several weeks before
you get a response. From this point you just need to wait. The vast
majority of cases will not even have a hearing you will simply recieve
your court order in the mail. The few cases that may get a hearing are
usually due to a judge wanting clarification on a criminal record. To
be clear they are only allowed to deny a name change if they have reason
to believe that it is to escape the law or creditors.
