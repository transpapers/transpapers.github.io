The first form to be filed is the Change
of Name (form PC8.1). On the bottom of the
first section fill out your mailing address
if it's different than your actual address.
If the box isn't already checked and you have 
changed your name before, check the “Yes” box 
and attach a copy of those documents otherwise 
check “No”. On the third section near the 
bottom of page 1 fill in any previous addresses 
you have lived at. Do <strong>not</strong>
sign it or fill out anything on page 2, that's
for a notary later.
