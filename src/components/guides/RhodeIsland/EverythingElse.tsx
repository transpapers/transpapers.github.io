      <h3>Everything Else (RI)</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have the court order and primary identification in your new
        name, you can change your name almost everywhere else without issue.
        Some places will even allow for digital updates by scanning in the ID
        and court order. What follows is a list of places, in no particular
        order, where you may want to update your name. Any forms that you fill
        out should be signed in your new name.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Bank</strong>: Bring your new ID and court order and request the
        name on your account(s) be changed. If you have a debit card or
        checkbook out of this account, then you will need to request new ones.
        Any joint account holders must also be present to sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Credit Card</strong>: Most creditors will require you to snail
        mail or fax a photocopy of your ID and court order. If a particular
        company is stubborn in updating the account name, consider canceling the
        card and opening a new card with them or another provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Work</strong>: If you have an HR system, bring your new ID, new
        social security card, and court order to them and ask them to update
        your information. If you get your health insurance through your work, you can
        have them send the updated information to them on your behalf. Some can do
        it online at this <a href="https://healthsourceri.com/">link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Healthcare Providers</strong>: You should be able to bring in
        only your new ID at your next in-person visit and go to the front
        secretaries to have your name updated in the system. Be aware that
        certain medical professionals will need to know your transition status.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gas/Heating/Electricity Provider</strong>: Should be
        able to be done by phone, email, or online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Water/Sewer</strong>: Should be able to be done by phone, email,
        or snail mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Internet Provider</strong>: Should be able to be done online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Garbage Service</strong>: Should be able to be done by email or
        snail mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mortgage</strong>: Should be able to be done by email or snail
        mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Property/House Title</strong>: Contact your county’s Registry of
        Deeds. A Grant or Quitclaim deed will need to be filed. Bring ID and 
        court order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Phone Service</strong>: Go to the nearest store of your carrier
        network with your new ID and court order and request your information be
        updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Taxes (IRS)</strong>: The IRS will be informed of your name
        change when you update your information with Social Security. You do <strong>not</strong>
        {" "}need to contact them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary School Records</strong>: Each school will have different
        requirements and protocols; contact them and see what theirs is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>College Records</strong>: Contact the Student Records Department
        of your university. Your court order and new ID should work. You may
        also consider asking about updating your school profile and email.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Insurance</strong>: Contact your insurer(s). Requirements will
        vary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Government Assistance</strong>: Contact your assistance agency
        to update their case file. You should only need a primary ID and court
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Voter Registration</strong>: Rhode Island has automatic voter
        registration, so no action is required unless you opted out when
        renewing your primary ID. If you were too young for that step, they
        should have your correct name and gender the first time you
        apply for a license, state ID, or otherwise register to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
