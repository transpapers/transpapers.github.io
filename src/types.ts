  // These are strings and not Dates for the sake of sanity.
  // One's "date of birth" is a legal abstraction, not a timestamp, which is
  // what a Date represents. In fact, it only needs to be treated as anything
  // other than a string for the purposes of determining majority.
  // There are some further corner cases to consider [0] but it's beyond scope
  // and so handled by the "age" field.
  // If the person was not born in the last 22 [1] years, that is to say, if
  // their legal year of birth is less than the current year minus 22, we don't
  // do any additional date math. We never convert the given DOB to a Date and
  // so avoid philosophically perplexing questions of time by shunting them to
  // whatever remedy the user and the legal system may have.

  // [1] In the state of Michigan, this is the last "breakpoint" at which the
