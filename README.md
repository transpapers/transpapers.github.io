# Transpapers

_Almost-fully-automated trans rights._

[Transpapers](https://transpapers.lgbt) is a web tool designed by Stephanie Beckon and [Sasha Lišková](https://sverona.dev) to automate as much of the process of legally affirming one's gender as possible.

Its methodology is documented here to be applicable to other states. Our goal is to spread almost-fully-automated trans rights as far as we can.

## Design

The web tool unifies the form fields of each of the documents to be filed into a single data object. It uses [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) to programmatically fill those documents and concatenates them into a single PDF document.

A personalized guide is also generated as a PDF using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and pdf-lib, and included in the printout.

To ensure data security, everything runs client-side. To protect against phishing [homograph attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack), the site is registered on the .lgbt TLD, which prohibits domains registered with intent to defraud or deceive. Domain abuse should be reported [to Identity Digital.](https://identity.digital/policies/report-abuse/)

## Data

In the process of developing this tool, we gathered court and sheriff locations (among other data) at the county level for multiple states. This data is available in each states folder as `counties.tsv`.

## Replication

TBD

## Support
