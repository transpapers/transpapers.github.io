          <strong>What is this?</strong>
          Transpapers is a trans-run, privacy-focused, free (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"
            ><em>libre</em></a
          >) web service that aims to lessen the burden of filing all those
          forms to have the state legally affirm your gender. This may be
          necessary for your mental health, personal safety, and/or affirming
          medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
          Select your birth state, current state of residence, and the
          information you wish to change. Fill out the form that appears and
          press "Download gender-affirming documents". Your browser will then
          download a PDF file comprising the forms you need to file, as well as
          a personalized guide to filing them. The forms will be prefilled using
          the information you entered.

          <strong>Is it safe to enter my personal data?</strong>
          Yes. Everything happens client-side; that is to say, on your computer.
          Your personal data will never be collected, retained, or in any way
          transmitted over the Internet. The especially privacy-conscious can

          <strong>My state isn't listed.</strong> Transpapers is developed by
          two people with day jobs. It's a lot of work to automate the legal
          processes of fifty-five states and territories. Send us a request at
          the feedback form below and we'll add it to the list. If you're a
