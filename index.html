            <strong>What is this?</strong>
            Transpapers aims to lessen the burden of filing all those forms to have the state
            legally affirm your gender. This may be necessary
            for your personal safety and/or to obtain affirming
            medical care.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
            Select your birth state, current state of residence, and
            the information you wish to change. Fill out the form that appears
            and press "Download gender-affirming documents".

            Your browser will then download a PDF file
            comprising the forms you need to file, as well as a
            personalized guide to filing them. The forms will
            be prefilled using the information you entered.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Is it safe to enter my personal data?</strong>
            Yes. Everything happens client-side; that is to
            say, on your computer. Your personal data will never
            be collected, retained, or in any way transmitted over the Internet. The especially privacy-conscious can even <a href="#">run the tool locally and offline.</a>
            (You should, however, ensure that your browser points to
            <a href=
            "https://transpapers.lgbt">https://transpapers.lgbt</a>;
            other addresses may not be secure.)
