            <strong>What is this?</strong>
            In the wake of attacks on our rights,
            this tool exists to lessen the burden of filling
            out and filing all those forms to have the state
            legally affirm your gender. This may be necessary
            for your personal safety and/or to obtain affirming
            medical care.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
            Complete the form below and press "Generate
            forms." Your browser will then download a PDF file
            comprising the forms you need to file, as well as a
            personalized guide to filing them. The forms will
            be prefilled using the information you entered.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Is it safe to enter my personal data?</strong>
            Yes. Everything happens client-side; that is to
            say, on your computer. Your personal data will not
            be transmitted over the Internet.</p>
            <p>You should ensure that your browser points to
            <a href=
            "https://transpapers.lgbt">https://transpapers.lgbt</a>;
            other addresses may not be secure.</p>
