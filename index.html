            <strong>What is this?</strong>
	    Transpapers is a trans-run, privacy-focused, free (<a
		    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"><em>libre</em></a>)
	    web
	    service that aims to lessen the burden of filing all those forms to
	    have the state
            legally affirm your gender. This may be necessary
            for your mental health, personal safety, and/or affirming
            medical care.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
            Select your birth state, current state of residence, and
            the information you wish to change. Fill out the form that appears
            and press "Download gender-affirming documents".

            Your browser will then download a PDF file
            comprising the forms you need to file, as well as a
            personalized guide to filing them. The forms will
            be prefilled using the information you entered.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Is it safe to enter my personal data?</strong>
            Yes. Everything happens client-side; that is to
            say, on your computer. Your personal data will never
            be collected, retained, or in any way transmitted over the Internet. The especially privacy-conscious can even <a href="#">run the tool locally and offline.</a>
            (You should, however, ensure that your browser points to
            <a href=
            "https://transpapers.lgbt">https://transpapers.lgbt</a>;
            other addresses may not be secure.)

	    <strong>My state isn't listed.</strong> Transpapers is developed by two people with day jobs. It's a lot of work to automate the legal processes of fifty-five states and territories. Send us a request at the feedback form below and we'll add it to the list. If you're a programmer, send us a pull request.
