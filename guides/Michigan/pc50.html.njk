  The state of Michigan generally requires name change hearings to be documented
in a local newspaper unless there are compelling reasons not to. This will take
the form of a notice containing the old and new legal names as well as the date,
time, and location of the hearing.
{% if age < 18 and parentsAreOkay == false %}
	List the legal names of any noncustodial parents under the heading
	“TO ALL PERSONS, including:”.
{% endif %}
You may need to write in the name of the publication that the notice will be
displayed in during filing; if so, refer to the list above. This form is
otherwise complete.
